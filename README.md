# Eye of the Storm
*Endgame content for against the storm*

Is [Against the Storm](https://www.gog.com/game/against_the_storm) too easy for you? Do you Prestige 20 dailies feel like a snoozefest? Fed up with all these casuals complaining about game mechanics. Does pressing the 'g' key on your keyboard autocomplete to 'git gud'? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions, **Eye of the Storm** is the mod for you. 

**This mod is currently InDev**. I'm looking for feedback/discussions with veteran Against the Storm players in order to turn Eye of the Storm in a goto endgame content mod which has additional difficulty levels and a different gameplay experience for people who can already win regular runs in their sleep and want more challenge. Get in touch on the [Against the Storm discord](https://discord.com/invite/against-the-storm) and leave your feedback

## Current Prestige Levels (SPOILERS AHEAD)

* **Prestige 21**: Trade routes cost an additional +2 provisions
* **Prestige 22**: Buildings demolished refund only 50% of their initial resource costs
* **Prestige 23**: You get only one species' embark bonus, chosen randomly on each species arrival
* **Prestige 24**: The act of calling a trader now costs 10 Amber
* **Prestige 25**: The decadence (= the increase of Resolve thresholds for gaining reputation) increase by 1
