# Eye of the Storm
*Endgame content for Against the Storm*

Do you think [Against the Storm](https://www.gog.com/game/against_the_storm) is too easy? Do Prestige 20 dailies feel like a snoozefest? Do you roll your eyes at these casuals complaining about 'unfair' game mechanics? Does pressing the 'g' key on your keyboard autocomplete to 'git gud'? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions, **Eye of the Storm** is the mod for you. 

**This mod is currently InDev**. I'm looking for feedback/discussions with veteran Against the Storm players in order to turn Eye of the Storm in a goto endgame content mod which has additional difficulty levels and a different gameplay experience for people who can already win regular runs in their sleep and want more challenge. Get in touch on the [Against the Storm discord](https://discord.com/invite/against-the-storm) and leave your feedback

## Current Prestige Levels (SPOILERS AHEAD)

Currently I add 5 prestige levels to the game. To see what these are, click the spoiler below
